Python Notebook of my university assignments with the CSV files
I have worked on these assignments for my university courses in Business Analytics. To see all the analysis you need to download CSV files along with the Jupyter Notebook to the same folder and run it as it needs to load information from those CSV files. There are some basic analysis like a number drawing system for a jackpot, some exploratory analysis as well as plots and charts created for exploratory analysis. Then there are some basic classification method of machine learning along with network analysis and language processing models. I have worked on these assignment completely on my own and have received perfect or close to perfect grades for them. There are also description about what was being done in many of the notebooks to show why a certain method was selected to perform the task.
